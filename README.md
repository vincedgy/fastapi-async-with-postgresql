# FastAPI async with Postgresql DB #

> Author : @vincedgy

The main goal of this little demonstration project is to explore [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework NOT
using [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) but a higher level abstraction.

This project is very much inspired by the very framework used tutorial
named ['databases'](https://pypi.org/project/databases/)
which gives asyncio support for a range of SQL databases.

Find the documentation of this project at [https://vincedgy.github.io/fastapi-async-with-postgresql/](https://vincedgy.github.io/fastapi-async-with-postgresql/).

Enjoy üç∫ !
