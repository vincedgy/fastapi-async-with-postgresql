The main goal of this little demonstration project is to explore [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework
using [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) WITH a higher level abstraction
named [databases](https://pypi.org/project/databases/).

This project is very much inspired by the tutorial of the framework itself taht you can find
at ['databases' QuickStart](https://www.encode.io/databases/#quickstart)
which gives asyncio support for a range of SQL databases.

Enjoy üç∫ !
